# R/Stan Codes for Anomaly Detection in Spatio-Temporal Sensor Data

This repository contains R codes that implement an anomaly detection framework for spatio-temporal sensor data. The codes perform the following tasks:

-    Simulate network data and anomalies: Generate synthetic data that simulates a network of sensor measurements with added anomalies.

-    Fit models: Fit statistical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

-    Predict anomalies: Utilize the fitted models to predict anomalies in the sensor data based on deviations from the expected patterns.

-    Compute performance measures: Evaluate the accuracy of the anomaly detection by computing various performance measures.

To run the codes, please follow the instructions provided within the R script file. Note that some of the files may require downloading large model files separately, as indicated in the code comments.
